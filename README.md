Week 3 Assignment – AI Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, spaCy
# Week 3 AI Tools Assignment – PLP Academy 

**By: Nimo Hussein**  
This project demonstrates practical use of AI frameworks – including Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and spaCy – through three key tasks: machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).


##  Project Overview

This assignment is divided into three parts:

1. **Iris Classification (Scikit-learn):**
   - Built a decision tree classifier to predict iris flower species based on petal/sepal data.
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

2. **MNIST Digit Recognition (TensorFlow):**
   - Used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0–9).
   - Achieved test accuracy of over 95%.
   - Visualized model predictions on sample images.

3. **Amazon Review Analysis (spaCy):**
   - Performed Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands.
   - Conducted basic sentiment analysis using a rule-based method.

## Learning Outcomes

- Applied classical ML and deep learning techniques.
- Understood the role of AI frameworks in real-world applications.
- Improved skills in model evaluation and NLP using pre-trained pipelines.
