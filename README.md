# Week 3 AI Tools Assignment – PLP Academy 

**By: Nimo Hussein** 

 Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (Week 3)
Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?
TensorFlow uses static computation graphs, making it better for production and deployment. It's ideal when you're scaling models or building apps.
PyTorch, on the other hand, uses dynamic computation graphs, which are more flexible and easier to debug — making it a favorite in research and experimentation.
Choose TensorFlow for deployment, and PyTorch for fast development and academic work.

Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
Experimenting with Models – Jupyter allows developers to write and test code in blocks, view outputs instantly, and make quick adjustments.

Learning and Collaboration – It's widely used in AI education and collaborative research because it supports code, visualizations, and explanations in one place.

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?
spaCy provides powerful NLP capabilities like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing — all using pre-trained models.
Unlike basic string methods (like .split() or .replace()), spaCy understands the structure and meaning of language, making it much more effective for real-world language processing.


##  Project Overview

This assignment is divided into three parts:

1. **Iris Classification (Scikit-learn):**
   - Built a decision tree classifier to predict iris flower species based on petal/sepal data.
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

2. **MNIST Digit Recognition (TensorFlow):**
   - Used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0–9).
   - Achieved test accuracy of over 95%.
   - Visualized model predictions on sample images.

3. **Amazon Review Analysis (spaCy):**
   - Performed Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands.
   - Conducted basic sentiment analysis using a rule-based method.

## Learning Outcomes

- Applied classical ML and deep learning techniques.
- Understood the role of AI frameworks in real-world applications.
- Improved skills in model evaluation and NLP using pre-trained pipelines.
